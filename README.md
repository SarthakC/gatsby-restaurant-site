This is a repo for a fully responsive marketing website designed for a fake local eatery. It was built using React, Gatsby and Styled-Components. Gatsby JS is a static site generator, which renders static HTML from the React app. This means the website loads extremely fast. It uses Contentful as a CMS to store menu items, this way non-developer teams can add and edit menu items with ease. It deployed on Netlify and utilizes web hooks to rebuild the website any time the git repo or contentful data are updated.
